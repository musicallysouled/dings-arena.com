		<h1>About us</h1>
		<p> Hello! Hope you're doing great. Glad to see you on this page. I'm Sayantani Dey, just an ordinary student who loves writing and connecting to fields that help and support people. In 2021, I was searching for a website that would include something that students usually search for, something different and peaceful. So, I thought to try it out myself and decided to build a webpage. My motive behind building this page was to collect and create objects that would help people, especially students. It is my goal to improvise this website further,so it becomes really useful. It's my indepth pleasure, if I have really helped you with this website.</p>
